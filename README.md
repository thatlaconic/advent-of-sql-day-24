# [Santas banging tunes ðŸŽ¶](https://adventofsql.com/challenges/24)

## Description
Santa was trying to pick the perfect song to play at the big after-Christmas party in the Alps. This was gonna be huge - he was DJing for the first time ever at this awesome party where elves, reindeer, and snowboarders would all hang out together. One of his smart elves helped him out by making a computer program that looked at what songs the elves had been listening to lately. It showed which songs people actually listened to all the way through and played over and over. Santa was super excited to DJ, knowing he'd find just the right banger to get everyone dancing and make the party totally epic!
